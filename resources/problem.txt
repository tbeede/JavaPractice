Claysef,

As agreed, here is the coding challenge.
 
See the two tab delimited files attached:

  products.tab = A list of product names tab delimited with categories
  sales.tab = A list of product names tab delimited with sales amount
 
From this data we'd like you to answer two questions:
	1.	What are the top 5 categories by sales
	2.	What is the minimum and maximum sale in the category 'Breakfast'
 
This comes from when someone worked at a company that made back office software for restaurants.

You can imagine the second file is a Point of Sale record for the day.

Please email the code in a zip file in approximately one hour, along with the answers.
If you have trouble emailing us the code, please send us a private gist (gist.github.com). 
P.S. - We've had people install MySQL, import the data and provide the answer by executing queries.  While that is a good approach, we'd rather see everything done within a self-contained, simple script.

P.P.S - You can do this in any language.  If you choose to use Java, here is an example on how to read a file:  http://www.programcreek.com/2011/03/java-read-a-file-line-by-line-code-example/
 
Good luck
